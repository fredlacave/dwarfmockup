Welcome to DwarfMockup !
========================

Purpose :
---------

This is a simple utility that allows you to quickly design rooms for Dwarf Fortress within a GUI.

The designs can then be imported into quickfort to translate them into orders for your dwarves...

Usage :
-------

Movement :
- To move the cursor, use either the numpad or the directional keys
- With `<Shift>` depressed, the cursor moves ten tiles at a time, DF like
- To move up and down the Z levels, use `<PageUp>` and `<PageDown>` or the numpad `<+>` and `<->`
- The `<Insert>` and `<Delete>` key dive you a peek at the levels above and below when pressed
- If you prefer, you can use the ghost (`<Shift-G>`) command to display a ghost image of the above and below levels
- To begin an action, press the `<Enter>` key

The other commands are all listed on the right.

The painted zone depends on the selection mode :
- `<Shift+R>` : full rectangles
- `<Shift+C>` : one tile width rectangle
- `<Shift+E>` : ellipses (the center will appear)
- `<Shift+O>` : one tile at a time

There are four main modes of operation : dig, items, stockpiles and adjust modes.  To switch between them, use `<Shift+M>`
and `<Shift-N>`.

In dig mode, it is possible to carve through rock (`<d>`), channel (`<h>`) or rebuild walls (`<w>`), carve stairs (`<j>`, `<i>`,
`<u>`) or ramps (`<m>`).  There is also the option decorate rooms and transform walls or ground into dirt (`<t>`), rough rock
(`<g>`), or smooth (`<s>`) and engrave (`<e>`) them.

The items mode is used to place diverse items on the map.

`<Ctrl-C>` enters copy mode, `<Ctrl-X>` enters cut mode, `<Ctrl-V>` pastes.

`<Shift-H>` toggles a crosshair centered on the cursor.

`<Shift-X>` places the center, used by quickfort to determine the starting point of the design.

`<Ctrl-S>` is used to save a template file (in the form of a few .csv files).  `<Ctrl-L>` is used to load a template,
either from a multi-layer quickfort file or a single layer .csv file.

`<Ctrl-H>` shows the help box.

`<Ctrl-Q>` quits.

`<Ctrl-A>` shows the about box, with licensing terms.

When first started, the software creates a "dwarfmockup.conf" file with the default config, and a "blueprints"
directory to store blueprints files.


Important note :
----------------

The Avira anti-virus program seems to believe that DwarfMockup.exe is infected with a trojan (TR/Dropper.Gen7).  This is
a false positive.

I believe it's caused by the OCRA system of embedding a ruby interpreter in one big exe file.

If you do not trust this file, you can always download the whole ruby source and execute with a ruby interpreter.
